# Emulation

pocknix-os ships **ES-DE** as the frontend, with RetroArch and a few standalone emulators doing
the work. It is "drop your files in and play": no per-emulator setup, and games you favorite in
ES-DE show up in your Steam library automatically.

For the full list of supported systems, see the [README](../README.md#emulation).

## Where your files go

Everything lives under `~/Emulation` (created for you on first login):

```
~/Emulation/
  ROMs/<system>/     your games, one folder per system (gba, snes, ps1, ps2, ...)
  BIOS/              BIOS / firmware / key files (see below)
  Saves/             in-game saves
  States/            save states
```

Drop each game into the folder for its system (`~/Emulation/ROMs/gba/`, `~/Emulation/ROMs/snes/`,
and so on), then rescan in ES-DE. A single copy of `~/Emulation` is self-contained: ROMs, BIOS,
and saves all travel together.

### Putting ROMs on an SD card

The ROM directory can live anywhere, and ES-DE is the single source of truth. Go to **ES-DE Menu
→ Other Settings → ROM directory** and point it at the new location (for example
`/run/media/<card>/ROMs`). Move your files there, then rescan. `BIOS/`, `Saves/`, and `States/`
stay in `~/Emulation`.

## BIOS and firmware

Some systems need BIOS or firmware files that pocknix cannot ship. Put them in
`~/Emulation/BIOS/`, and **use the exact filenames** below:

| System | File(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **PlayStation 2** | `ps2-bios.bin` | Rename your BIOS dump to exactly this. Any region works. |
| PlayStation | `scph5501.bin` (US), `scph5500.bin` (JP), `scph5502.bin` (EU) | Standard names, as dumped. |
| Dreamcast | `dc/dc_boot.bin`, `dc/dc_flash.bin` | Note the `dc/` subfolder. |
| Sega CD | `bios_CD_U.bin`, `bios_CD_E.bin`, `bios_CD_J.bin` | One per region. |
| Game Boy Advance | `gba_bios.bin` | Optional; improves accuracy. |
| **Nintendo Switch** | `prod.keys`, `title.keys` + firmware | Not in `BIOS/`. Eden: keys in `~/.local/share/eden/keys/`, firmware `.nca` files in `~/.local/share/eden/nand/system/Contents/registered/`. Ryujinx: keys in `~/.config/Ryujinx/system/`, firmware installed from its own menu. |

If a game will not boot, the emulator's error message usually names the exact file it is missing.
A missing or misnamed BIOS is the most common cause.

## Copying files over the network

Rather than shuttling a microSD card back and forth, you can turn the device into a network
share and drag files straight onto it from another computer. It works out of the box in macOS
Finder, Windows Explorer and Linux file managers - no extra software on either end.

Turn it on in either place:

- **Game Mode**: Quick Access Menu → **Pocknix Control** → **Library** → *Share my home folder*
- **Desktop**: **Pocknix Tools** → *File sharing (SMB) is off - turn it on...*

The first time, you will be offered a 7.4 MB download (Samba is not shipped in the image, so
devices that never share a file never pay for it). It then stays on across reboots until you
turn it off in the same place.

Once it is on, open one of these from the other computer:

| | |
|---|---|
| macOS | Finder → the device appears in the sidebar under **Network**, or press ⌘K and enter `smb://pocknix.local` |
| Windows | Explorer address bar: `\\pocknix` |
| Linux | Files → *Other Locations* → `smb://pocknix.local` |

**Connect as Guest - there is no password.** Two shares appear:

- **deck** - your home folder, so `Emulation/` for ROMs and BIOS, and the per-emulator folders
  described above for firmware and keys
- **sdcard** - whatever is in the SD card slot

> [!WARNING]
> There is no password, so **anyone on the same network** can read and write everything in your
> home folder - not just games and saves, but your Steam login and SSH keys too. Sharing is
> limited to private home-network address ranges, so joining public wifi does not expose the
> device, but treat it as "on while I am at home" rather than something to leave running.

## Getting games into Steam

Favorite a game in ES-DE (the Favorite button), quit ES-DE, and re-enter Game Mode. The game
appears in your Steam library in a "Pocknix" collection, ready to launch straight from Big
Picture. Un-favorite to remove it. Favorites are synced when you enter Game Mode, so they show up
on the next entry, never mid-session.

## Tweaking individual emulator settings

Defaults are tuned for the RP6, but you can change per-emulator settings any time:

- **RetroArch systems** (NES, SNES, N64, Game Boy, GBA, DS, Genesis, Saturn, Dreamcast,
  PlayStation, PSP, Arcade, and more): while a game is running, open the **RetroArch Quick Menu**
  (hold Select and press X on the controller, or press F1 on a keyboard). From there you can
  change the core options, video/shader settings, controls, and save an override that applies to
  that game or that whole system.
- **Standalone emulators** (ARMSX2 for PS2, Dolphin for GameCube/Wii, PPSSPP for PSP, Azahar for
  3DS, Eden or Ryujinx for Switch): each has its own in-app settings menu. Launch the emulator
  from the desktop to reach its full configuration UI.

Settings you change are yours: when a Pocknix update ships a better default, only settings you
never touched follow it. **Pocknix Tools** has a *Restore emulator default settings* entry that
puts a single emulator back to the shipped defaults, keeping your old file as a `.bak` copy.

## Using your own emulator build

Every standalone emulator has a folder under `~/Emulation/emulators/`: `eden`, `ryujinx`,
`armsx2`, `rpcs3`, `vita3k`, `xemu`, `dolphin`, `cemu`, `azahar`, `ppsspp`. Put **one** file in
it, an AppImage or a binary, and Pocknix launches that instead of its own build, from ES-DE and
from Steam favorites alike, with the same pre-made settings. Remove the file to go back to the
built-in one. A folder with more than one file is ignored.

**Nintendo Switch is bring-your-own only.** Pocknix ships no Switch emulator. Drop an Eden or a
Ryujinx build into its folder and it is set up on first launch: controller, fullscreen, vsync and
resolution. With both present, choose which one runs in ES-DE under *Other Settings, Alternative
Emulators*; Steam favorites follow that choice. If you had Eden installed by an earlier Pocknix
version, it is moved into `~/Emulation/emulators/eden/` for you and keeps working.

## What is already set up for you

- **RetroArch**: controller mapping, 120Hz-panel frame pacing, and sensible per-system tuning
  (for example integer scaling and an LCD shader on GBA).
- **PlayStation 2 (ARMSX2)**: setup wizard skipped, Vulkan renderer, controller bound, and
  upscaling enabled. You only supply `ps2-bios.bin` and your games.
- **Nintendo Switch (Eden or Ryujinx, your own build)**: controller bound, fullscreen, vsync and
  resolution tuned for the panel. You supply the emulator, your keys and firmware (see above)
  and your games.
- **ES-DE**: scans `~/Emulation/ROMs` and already knows where every emulator is installed.
