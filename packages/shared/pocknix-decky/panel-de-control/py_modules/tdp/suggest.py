"""Suggestion brain — turn a game's per-PL1 telemetry into a learned TDP band.

Pure functions, no I/O. Mirror of ``fans/suggest.py`` but for power: instead of a
fan curve we derive a ``[floor, ceil]`` watt band + a habitual ``seed`` for the
live auto-TDP loop to operate within, plus a dial that picks the resting target
inside that band (battery ↔ performance).

The honest contract: we can only infer a band once we've actually observed the
game at **several PL1 levels** for long enough — otherwise ``enough`` is False and
the caller falls back to the device's full range (never a fabricated band).

Floor honesty is GPU-PRIMARY (``_satisfied``), matching the honest signal the
control loop acts on. A PL1 level "had headroom" when the GPU was NOT saturated
there (``gpu_avg < _GPU_STARVED``). On a power-limited game the draw just follows
PL1, so watts/boost are confounded — they can't tell "has margin" from "needs it"
(a 35 W cap with the GPU stable at 80% looks like "no headroom" by watts, yet 80%
GPU means there IS margin). GPU utilisation is the only honest "could it go lower?"
signal, so the learned floor and the loop's knee converge on the same PL1. A level
that pinned the GPU is power-limited, not satisfied — so it can never be the floor.
watts/boost remain only as fallbacks for a device with no GPU% reading.
