Real per-button remap by cooperatively driving the daemon. The remappable buttons

Legion, Claw, Ally each expose a different set), and an override is applied by
merging it into the device's current profile (preserving defaults) and loading it.
Global (IP profiles are global) — per-game remap is Steam Input's job.
