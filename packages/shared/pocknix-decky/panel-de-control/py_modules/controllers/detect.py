"""Detect which controller manager owns the gamepad on this handheld.

On every target device the raw controller is exclusively grabbed by a resident
daemon — Handheld Daemon (HHD) on Bazzite, InputPlumber on SteamOS — which also
owns button/paddle remapping. Panel de Control NEVER grabs evdev itself (that
would fight the daemon and break input, the same lesson as the display color
work); instead it cooperates with whichever manager is present. This module
identifies it so the Mandos UI can drive the right backend.
