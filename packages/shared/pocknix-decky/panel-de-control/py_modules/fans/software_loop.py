"""Software-loop fan backends — for devices with NO hardware temp→pwm curve
table. We are the controller: read temp, interpolate the (canonical 0–255 pwm)
curve to a duty, map duty → an RPM target, write it, and re-assert periodically
(the EC reclaims the fan otherwise). Release = hand control back to firmware.

Members: Steam Deck (steamdeck_hwmon `fan1_target` RPM). Legion Go 2 (raw EC)
is a separate W4 backend with the same shape.

Canonical curve stays temp→pwm(0–255); each backend reinterprets pwm/255 as a
fraction of its RPM range so the curve representation is portable.
